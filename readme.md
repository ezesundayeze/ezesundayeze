Hi there, 
I'm Eze Sunday Eze! A software engineer with a special focus on web technologies. I've had the opportunity to build some pretty cool projects like Relaywash, an app that makes cleaning services a breeze. And Lopeer, a friendly app that helps people manage their finances and dabble in crypto investment. 

In the past, I've had the pleasure to work with great teams at Helium Health and Field Intelligence, and I'm also a certified developer for Near Blockchain - a detail I'm pretty proud of! 

But I'm not just about coding; I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences as a technical writer and trainer. My writings have helped over 5 million developers solve their coding problems. And when I'm not doing all of that, I'm contributing to the open-source community.
